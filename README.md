# Comprehensive Plan for Expanding the Expense Tracker Project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a robust Expense Tracker System that is professional, scalable, and realistic for everyday use. The system will manage expenses, goals, movie ratings, bills, and more, while being designed with a clear structure that emulates real-world projects. This documentation outlines the steps, relationships between components, tasks, and features to ensure successful development.

## Project Phases

### **Phase 1: Core System Expansion**
**Purpose**: Expand the existing expense tracker with additional tables, features, and functionality.

1. **Tables to Add:**
   - **Movies**:
     - Fields: `Movie_ID`, `Title`, `Genre`, `Release_Date`, `Rating`, `Review`
   - **Bills**:
     - Fields: `Bill_ID`, `Category`, `Amount`, `Due_Date`, `Paid_Status`
   - **Goals**:
     - Fields: `Goal_ID`, `Description`, `Start_Date`, `End_Date`, `Status`

2. **New Features:**
   - Track and review movies.
   - Manage monthly bills.
   - Set, monitor, and update life goals.

3. **Purpose:**
   - Broaden the project's use cases for real-life personal management.
   - Allow interconnection between data (e.g., movie reviews based on expenses).

---

### **Phase 2: System Design Improvements**
**Purpose**: Enhance the system’s architecture for better usability and scalability.

1. **Backend:**
   - Add modularized Flask blueprints for scalability.
   - Create RESTful APIs for CRUD operations for each table.
   - Add validation for user input to ensure data consistency.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Use Bootstrap for a responsive and modern design.
   - Implement reusable templates with Jinja2.
   - Make all pages mobile-friendly.

3. **Database:**
   - Normalize tables to avoid redundancy.
   - Add indexes for faster queries.
   - Create stored procedures for complex queries.

4. **Purpose:**
   - Make the project maintainable, professional, and scalable.

---

### **Phase 3: Data Analysis and Insights**
**Purpose**: Enable data-driven decisions by providing insights and analytics.

1. **Features:**
   - Add a dashboard to visualize:
     - Monthly expense trends.
     - Bill payment statuses.
     - Goal progress over time.
   - Export data to Excel/CSV.

2. **Technologies:**
   - Use Chart.js or Plotly for interactive charts.
   - Implement Pandas for backend data analysis.

3. **Purpose:**
   - Provide actionable insights for better personal management.

---

### **Phase 4: Infrastructure Understanding**
**Purpose**: Simulate a real-world environment.

1. **Simulated Local Deployment:**
   - Run the system on Docker containers for the database, backend, and frontend.
   - Use tools like Postman for API testing.

2. **Logging and Debugging:**
   - Implement logging for backend activities (e.g., database queries, API requests).
   - Use tools like Python’s `logging` module.

3. **Purpose:**
   - Build understanding of infrastructure components like servers, APIs, and debugging workflows.

---

## System Relationships
1. **Frontend to Backend**:
   - The frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) sends user input to the backend (Flask) using forms or AJAX.
   - Backend validates input, processes logic, and interacts with the database.

2. **Backend to Database**:
   - Backend performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database using SQL.

3. **Frontend to Database**:
   - Users indirectly interact with the database via the frontend interface.

4. **API Integration**:
   - Expose APIs for mobile apps or external integrations (e.g., exporting data).

---

## Task Breakdown

### **Database Tasks**
1. Design and normalize tables.
2. Create relationships between tables (e.g., foreign keys).
3. Write SQL scripts for table creation and seed data.
4. Add constraints and indexes for data integrity and performance.

### **Backend Tasks**
1. Create Flask blueprints for modularization.
2. Build RESTful APIs for each table.
3. Add data validation and error handling.
4. Write unit tests for API endpoints.

### **Frontend Tasks**
1. Design a modern and responsive UI using Bootstrap.
2. Implement reusable components (e.g., navigation bar, forms).
3. Use Jinja2 templates for dynamic content.
4. Add interactivity with JavaScript.

### **Data Analysis Tasks**
1. Use Pandas to analyze expenses, bills, and goals.
2. Generate interactive charts with Chart.js or Plotly.
3. Implement filters and search functionality on the dashboard.

### **Testing and Debugging Tasks**
1. Test API endpoints with Postman.
2. Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
3. Validate user input on the frontend and backend.
4. Debug performance issues with logging.

## Expanded Features

1. **User Accounts:**
   - Allow multiple users to manage their own data.
   - Add authentication (e.g., login/signup).

2. **Recurring Bills:**
   - Automate monthly bill reminders.

3. **Expense Categories:**
   - Categorize expenses (e.g., food, rent, entertainment).
   - Visualize spending by category.

4. **Goal Prioritization:**
   - Assign priorities to goals (high, medium, low).
